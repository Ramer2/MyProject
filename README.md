# MyProject
(Yes,  I know that this is a README file for some serious shit, but I do not care. This is my project, my files, my efforts and my tears, and you are most likely just a guest. Be guest-y.)
### Objectives:
##### - Gain new skills (for Java)
- working with functions
- working with classes
- working with objects
#### - Create something BIIIIG
